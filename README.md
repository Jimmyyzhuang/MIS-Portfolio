## About Me
Hello! 

I'm a 4th-year Management Information Systems (MIS) student at San Jose State University and have a great interest in the process of business decision-making using technology and data. Coursework and practical projects have allowed me to learn about systems analysis, database design, Python development, Networking/ IT and working in agile project management.

I have done team-based projects with SQL database systems, interactive python applications, and end-to-end system design with tools such as Jira, Lucidchart, MySQL, and Tableau. I have a reputation of being reliable, efficient, and team players and I like working in groups so as to transform ideas into viable solutions. I am actively trying to leverage change to advance my expertise in technology, business, and analytics. 

On my free time, I enjoy spending quality time with my girlfriend and friends. I'm also a big foodie so I like to try a wide variety of food which is perfect since San Jose is one of the most diverse cities with the best food.

Please feel free to send a connect request anytime! ✌️
